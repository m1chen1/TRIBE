## Name
A Quest Called TRIBE_Clustering Malware Families for Enhanced Triage and Analysis

## Description

The project aims to enhance machine learning-based malware classification by developing a novel model, named Tribal Relation Inferential Binary Encoder (TRIBE), which groups malware into 'tribes' based on binary data from a malware file. Utilizing a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder, the project seeks to improve the speed and accuracy of malware classification, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods for malware triage. This approach looks to enhance malware incident response by providing an effective and efficient immediate classification system.

This project is originally based on the proposed Trident by Michael Chen. We have access to a multi-thousand dollar GPU hosted outside of the USNA to do analysis of malware binaries. We are looking to publish two papers. The first of which will cover the data collection and a review of our custom autoencode. The second will cover the malware analysis and ML grouping we do with the data. Our larger goal is to improve the classification time of malware so customers like SOCs can quickly and efficiently respond to threats. This is a unique methodology approach to malware classification.
